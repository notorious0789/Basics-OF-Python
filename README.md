## Title:
Python Environment, Data Types, Operators, and Basic Input/Output

## Aim:
To study the Python programming environment and interface, understand execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations in Python.


## Objectives:
•	To understand the Python programming environment and interface
•	To study Python execution modes
•	To understand comments in Python
•	To learn variables, identifier rules, and data types
•	To study different operators and expressions
•	To understand basic input and output mechanisms


## Theory:
### 1. Python Environment and Interface
The Python environment provides tools and interfaces to write, execute, and debug Python programs. Python programs can be executed using different interfaces such as:
•	Python Shell
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Spyder, PyCharm, and VS Code
•	Cloud-based platforms like Google Colab
The interface allows users to write code, execute instructions, and view results interactively.

### 2. Python Execution Modes
Python supports two main execution modes:
a) Interactive Mode
•	Commands are executed one line at a time
•	Immediate output is displayed
•	Useful for testing small code snippets and learning
Examples: Python shell, Jupyter Notebook cells, Google Colab
b) Script Mode
•	Programs are written in a file and executed as a whole
•	Suitable for developing complete applications
•	Files usually have .py extension

### 3. Comments in Python
Comments are non-executable statements used to explain code and improve readability.
•	Single-line comments: Begin with #
•	Multi-line comments: Written using triple quotes (""" """)
Comments help in documentation and understanding program logic.

### 4. Variables and Identifiers
A variable is a named memory location used to store data values.
Rules for Identifiers:
•	Must start with a letter (A–Z, a–z) or underscore _
•	Cannot start with a digit
•	Case-sensitive
•	Should not use Python keywords
Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variables do not require explicit data type declaration.

#### 5. Data Types in Python
Python provides several built-in data types to store different kinds of data.
Basic Data Types
•	Integer (int): Whole numbers
•	Floating-point (float): Decimal numbers
•	String (str): Sequence of characters
•	Boolean (bool): True or False
The data type of a variable can be identified using the type() function.

### 6. Operators and Expressions
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.
Types of Operators
•	Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical calculations
(+, -, *, /, %)
•	Relational Operators: Used for comparison
(>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
•	Logical Operators: Used to combine conditions
(and, or, not)
•	Assignment Operators: Used to assign values
(=, +=, -=, *=, /=)
•	Bitwise Operators: Perform operations at bit level
(&, |, ^, <<, >>)
An expression is a combination of operators and operands that produces a result.

### 7. Basic Input and Output Operations
Input and output operations allow interaction between the user and the program.
•	Input:
input() function is used to accept input from the user.
Input is treated as a string by default and may require type conversion.
•	Output:
print() function is used to display output.
Formatted output can be achieved using commas or formatted strings.

## Conclusion: 
Thus, the Python programming environment, execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations were studied and understood.
